## Weather Forecast

Initially, I loaded the data about the maximum temperature in R and performed some EDA.
I used gg_season() to identify any patterns for April. Between 1970 and 2020 
the highest maximum temperature in April was 34.5 and the
lowest maximum temperature in
April was 11.7.
Furthermore, I plotted the distribution of the daily maximum temperature for every decade in the dataset and derived that the mean was around 20 for all 5 decades. The distributions were normal with a little right skew.
Based on the assumption of normally distributed data for the maximum temperature in April, I calculated the mean and the appropriate 80% confidence intervals. However, they were very narrow, so I decided to use a different approach. I
assumed that within all days in April the values of maximum temperature are uniformly distributed. As so, for every year in the dataset I calculated the highest maximum temperature in April  and the
lowest maximum temperature in
April. These two distributions were also approximately normal with small skew. Based on that I re-calculated the mean and the 80% confidence intervals for each distribution. Accordingly, I approximated the point forecast as the mean of the mean maximum temperatures distribution and the mean of the lowest maximum temperatures.
For the confidence interval I included the lowest quantile from the lowest temperatures distribution and the upper quantile from the maximum temperatures distribution.
The point forecast was set to 21.5 degrees and the CI to [14.3 - 29.0]80%.

Moving one, I also decided to attempt to fit some exponential smoothing models to take advantage of the seasonality and trend in the data. I used a box_cox transformation in the maximum temperature, to make sure that the prediction intervals would be positive, and then I modeled the maximum temperature using a seasonal naive method a simple exponential smoothing method('A', 'A', 'A), a Damped Holt's method ('A', 'Ad', 'A) and a combination of all three methods.
After fitting the models in the test set that withheld data from 2014-2020, I measured the accuracy of the models and determined that Damped Holt's method produced better distributional and point forecast. As so I used only this method to forecast the future values. This model suggested a point forecast of
23.4 and a CI of [13.84853, 37.22497]80.
The point forecasts and the lower CI of my two approaches 
are close but the upper CI from the ETS model is even higher than the all-time maximum temperature in April.
I wasn't aware how I should properly combine these forecasts, so using a little judgment, I concluded in a point forecast of 22.6
and a confidence interval of
[13.84853 - 30.9]80%.
