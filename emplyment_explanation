## Employment Forecast

For this forecast, I obtained the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (Both seasonaly adjusted  and  not adjusted)
The seasonaly adjusted data showed a highly increasing trend and the impact of COVID-19 seemed to eclipse, since the total employed(seasonaly adjusted) of Jan-21 was close to that of Nov-19. 
The ranged from 1970 to 2021, so firstly I grouped them by decade and obtain the minimum, maximum, and mean levels of employmed people in April, to get some sence of the confidence intervals and their progression by decade.

Using gg_season and gg_subseries I observed a slight increase in April values after 2000 except for 2020, were the total employed value dropepd significantly. 

I decided to try to model both the adjusted and the unadjusted data to compare the estimates, and to exploit the seasonality of the later.

Both the nominal and the differenced values of the time sereis showased strong autocoleration with past values, especially in lag 12.

I decided to experiment by fitting Exponential smoothing models with multiplicative seasonality for the not-adjusted data and with no seasonality for the adjusted data. Furthermore, to exploit the high corellation between the lagged values of the time-series I attempted to fit some Arima models, based on the textbook(although I had trouble choosing the tuning parameters). Finally, for the not adjusted data, I tried to use prophet model (mostly out of curiosity). For the seasonaly adjusted data the arima model performed exceptionally well, outperforming the prophet and the ETS methods.

After training ther models, withholding values between 2013-2018, the measurements of accuracy showed that the arima model, performed better.
Based on that I forecasetd the seasonally adjusted estimate of total employment for April 2021 to be 12920109 and the confidence interval
[12818954, 13056068]80.

I am not very confident on my estimate based on the fact that I couldn't think of how to adjust the time-series forecast based on the impact of COVID-19.
